Now I be driving foreign cars
That picture perfect shit like that
Whoever thought I'd be a sta-a-a-a-ar?
Picture perfect shit like that

Ain't nobody believe me
Call me phony, call me greedy
Niggas mad cause they ain't eating

Nobody had time for it
I had to put my mind to it
Iont think my shit don't sta-a-a-ank
Not picture perfect, shit like that
I'm on top of my city
Whoever thought some shit like that?
Now I be driving foreign cars
That picture perfect shit like that
Whoever thought I'd be a sta-a-a-a-ar?
Now picture perfect shit like that
